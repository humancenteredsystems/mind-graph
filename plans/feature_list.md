- Different node shapes for different levels
- Connect two nodes
- Ability to implement a structured node hierarchy
    - New standalone nodes default to level 1
    - New connected nodes default to parent + 1
    - Levels, and only levels, determine the position in the hierarchy
    - Types are associated with levels, but their association is configurable as part of the graph settings.
    - Multiple types can be associated with a given level (e.g., Level 1 = Transportation, Level 2 = Car, Truck, Motorcycle)
- Arrange nodes based on hierarchy levels
- Expand children for selected nodes
- Expand / contract
- Node multi-select
- Hotkeys
- Mind map type nodes - "I want my nodes to look like Simple Mind Pro"
- Swooping edges
- Checklist nodes
- Rate limite API requests
